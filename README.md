# Dice Roller

This is a simple dice roller program. I created this project to explore the distribution of results when rolling multiple dice a set number of times.

## How it Works

1. Choose the type of dice you want to roll (e.g., 6-sided, 10-sided, 20-sided, etc.).
2. Specify the number of dice you want to roll.
3. Set the number of times you want to roll the dice.
4. Run the program, and it will simulate the rolls and display the distribution of results.

## Usage

To use the dice roller:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `dice_roller.py` file in a Python environment.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify the type and number of dice, as well as the number of rolls.
4. Run the program, and it will provide you with the distribution of results.

## Example

Here's an example of rolling 3 six-sided dice 1000 times:
Type of Dice: 6-sided
Number of Dice: 3
Number of Rolls: 1000

Results:
3: 12.5%
4: 18.2%
5: 24.6%
6: 21.8%
7: 13.5%
8: 5.3%
9: 2.3%
10: 1.0%
11: 0.0%
12: 0.0%
