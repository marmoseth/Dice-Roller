# Dice Roller

This is a notebook of a simple dice roller program. I created this project to explore the distribution of results when rolling multiple dice a set number of times.

## How it Works

1. Choose the type of dice you want to roll (e.g., 6-sided, 10-sided, 20-sided, etc.).
2. Specify the number of dice you want to roll.
3. Set the number of times you want to roll the dice.
4. Run the program, and it will simulate the rolls and display the distribution of results.
